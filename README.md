# Hey there, I'm *mhahnFr*!
As of now, I speak three languages: <p align="left"><a href="localhost" target="_blank"> <img src="raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/c/c-plain.svg" alt="C Programming language" width="40" height="40"/></a>

<details><summary>Currently I am studying at the <b>42 Heilbronn</b>. <i>(Click for more informations)</i></summary>

## [42 Heilbronn]
The [42 Heilbronn] is a coding school with a completely new educational design.
There are no teachers, everyone is learning by everyone. This design, called
``peer learning``, challenges traditional education principles very
successfully. One can learn coding from scratch, but also people with a coding
background are welcomed.

Repositories that belong to projects of the [42 School] are preceeded by
``42cursus``. More informations about the [42 Heilbronn] can be found on their
website: [42heilbronn.de](https://www.42heilbronn.de/learncoderepeat)

You can contact me on [Slack] as well as on [Discord]. My 42 intra profile can
be found [here](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/mhahn).

## Developer story
I started my journey of programming back in 2012, when I was 12 years old. I
started by reading a book about the [Java Programming Language]. After that, I
wrote a few projects in order to learn more about the main principles of
coding. After going through a second book, I wrote the [iSongs-RadioText]
project.

In 2015, I jumped on the Android platform and wrote a few apps,
including the [Rock-Paper-Scissors] app. Later, in 2016, I started
experimenting with OpenGL ES on Android. In addition to that project, I wrote
the [Shader IDE] to improve the workflow with the GLSL shaders. As I used the
Wavefront format for the 3D data for my app, I wrote the [Object Converter] in
2017, which converts the Wavefront 3D data in my own file format, called
**G**raphic**W**orld**O**bjects. Also in 2017, I wrote a small application to
automatically connect to my Android device, the [ADB Connector].

After having done all these projects, I made in 2018 an application to make
backups of my projects, the [Project Backupper]. Initially, it should simply
copy registered files to a specific location. As I was working in a virtual
machine, I had the problem that the guest was able to see the host's file
system, but the host could not see the guest's file system. To be still able to
copy the files, I added the possibility to use two instances of the
application, one inside of the VM, one on the host machine. The two instances
are communicating via the local network.

In 2019, I remade the [iSongs-RadioText] project, showing my capabilities of
coding in the [Java Programming language]. After finishing it, having made all
projects using the [Java Programming language], I decided to move on with
another language, the [Swift Programming language]. I started learning the
[Swift Programming language] already back in 2016, but my first project is from
2019, the [ADB Connector Mac]. This is a remake of the [ADB Connector], which
was written in a quick and dirty way.

In the second half of 2020, I started learning C++. But soon in the beginning
of 2021, I discovered the [42 School], and I decided to give the [42 Heilbronn]
a try. Having been selected after the [piscine], I became one of the first
students to discover the freshly opened [42 Heilbronn]. The language used in
their core [curriculum] is the C Programming language. Later on, other
programming languages are also used.
