### Developer story
I started my journey of programming back in 2012, when I was 12 years old. I started by reading a book about the
[Java Programming Language]. After that, I wrote a few projects in order to learn more about the main principles of 
coding. After going through a second book, I wrote the [iSongs-RadioText] project.

In 2015, I jumped on the Android platform and wrote a few apps, including the
<a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/RockPaperScissors">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> app. Later, in 2016, I started
experimenting with OpenGL ES on Android. In addition to that project, I wrote the
<a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/ShaderIDE">Shader IDE</a> to improve the workflow with the GLSL shaders. As I
used the Wavefront format for the 3D data for my app, I wrote the
<a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/Object_Converter">Object Converter</a> in 2017, which converts the Wavefront 3D
data in my own file format, called <b>G</b>raphic<b>W</b>orld<b>O</b>bjects. Also in 2017, I wrote a small application to
automatically connect to my Android device, the <a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/ADB_Connector">ADB Connector</a>.

After having done all these projects, I made in 2018 an application to make backups of my projects, the <a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/Project_Backupper">Project Backupper</a>.
Initially, it should simply copy registered files to a specific location. As I was working in a virtual machine, I had the
problem that the guest was able to see the host's file system, but the host could not see the guest's file system. To be
still able to copy the files, I added the possibility to use two instances of the application, one inside of the VM, one
on the host machine. The two instances are communicating via the local network.

In 2019, I remade the [iSongs-RadioText] project, showing my capabilities of coding in the [Java Programming language].

After finishing it, having made all projects using the <a href="https://www.github.com/openjdk">Java Programming language</a>,
I decided to move on with another language, the <a href="https://www.github.com/apple/swift">Swift Programming language</a>.
I started learning the <a href="https://www.github.com/apple/swift">Swift Programming language</a> already back in 2016,
but my first project is from 2019, the <a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/ADB_Connector_Mac">ADB Connector Mac</a>.
This is a remake of the <a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/ADB_Connector">ADB Connector</a>, which was written in a
quick and dirty way.

In the second half of 2020, I started learning C++. But soon in the beginning of 2021, I discovered the
<a href="https://www.github.com/42-Heilbronn">42 School</a>, and I decided to give the
<a href="https://www.42heilbronn.de/learncoderepeat">42 Heilbronn</a> a try. Having been selected after the
<a href="https://www.42heilbronn.de/learncoderepeat">piscine</a>, I became one of the first students to discover the
newly opened <a href="https://www.42heilbronn.de/learncoderepeat">42 Heilbronn</a>. The language used in their core
<a href="https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/curriculum">curriculum</a> is the C Programming language. Later on, the C++ 
Programming language and other languages are also used.</br>
Here, I developed the <a href="https://www.github.com/nijakow/four">four</a> MUD together with <a href="https://www.github.com/nijakow">nijakow</a>.
Later on, I wrote the <a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/LeakSanitizer">LeakSanitizer</a>.
