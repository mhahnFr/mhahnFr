### Developer story
I started coding when I was `12` years old using Java.

Below you can find some [Highlights](#Highlights) and the [timeline](#Timeline) of my coding history. 

### Highlights
Some noticeable projects:
- [LeakSanitizer]: A library capable to show the memory leaks and to examine the memory usage of a program linked to it.
- [SecretPathway]: A [MUD] client written for macOS.
- [miniRT]: A small raytracer, part of the projects at the [42 Heilbronn].
- [FdF]: A 3D wireframe viewer, also part of the projects of the [42 Heilbronn].

### Timeline

#### 2022
Since 2022 I am developing the [SecretPathway], which is a MUD client. The macOS version is written in Swift.  
A Java version can be found [here](https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/SecretPathway).

Earlier in the year, I wrote the [LeakSanitizer] and its accompanying [CallstackLibrary].  
The [LeakSanitizer] is capable to display the memory leaks of program that is linked to it.

The [CallstackLibrary] creates human-readable callstacks at any requested point in the program.

#### 2021 - 2022
As a side project, I contributed to [four], a [MUD] written by [nijakow].

Since its opening in <i>June 2021</i> I am studying at the <a href="">42 Heilbronn</a>. This is a coding school which features a unique
learning model:<br>
Everybody is learning from everybody - without teachers. This principle, called <b>peer learning</b>, challenges the
traditional learning models quite successfully.<br>
42 schools can be found around the globe, see <a href="https://www.42heilbronn.de">their official website</a>.<br>
My 42 intra profile can be found <a href="https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/mhahn">here</a>.

Repositories containing projects belonging to the [42 Heilbronn] are preceded by `42cursus`.

Before starting at the <a href="https://www.42heilbronn.de/learncoderepeat">42 Heilbronn</a>, I started to learn C++.

#### 2019 - 2020
Before I moved on to C++, I wrote the [ADB Connector] for *macOS* using Swift.

#### 2019
In 2019, I rewrote the [iSongs-RadioText] project, showing my capabilities in Java.

#### 2017 - 2018
From 2017 to 2018 I wrote the [Project Backupper], a Java application to create backups. It features a server / client
principle, as it was supposed to create backups from Virtual Machines.

#### 2017
Earlier in that year, I wrote the first version of the [ADB Connector] in Java.

In the same year, I wrote the [Object Converter], a Java application that converts 3D worlds between the well-known
[Wavefront] format and my own format, called **G**raphic**W**orld**O**bjects.

#### 2016 - 2017

I wrote that tool as I was experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES">OpenGL ES</a> on <a href="https://developer.android.com">Android</a>.

#### 2016

Before and meanwhile, I learned Swift and experimented with iOS.

#### 2015 - 2016

Prior to that, I wrote my first <a href="https://developer.android.com">Android</a> app, the <a href="https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/RockPaperScissors">RockPaperScissors</a> app.

#### 2013 - 2015
Before experimenting with [Android], I wrote a music application in Java, after reading a second book about Java.

#### 2013
Prior, I wrote a desktop version of the [RockPaperScissors] game in Java.

### 2012 - 2013
