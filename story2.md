### Developer story
I started coding when I was `12` years old using Java.

Below you can find some [Highlights](#Highlights) and the [timeline](#Timeline) of my coding history. 

### Highlights
Some noticable projects:
- [LeakSanitizer]: A library capable to show the memory leaks and to examine the memory usage of a program linked to it.
- [SecretPathway]: A [MUD] client written for macOS.
- [miniRT]: A small raytracer, part of the projects at the [42 Heilbronn].
- [FdF]: A 3D wireframe viewer, also part of the projects of the [42 Heilbronn].

### Timeline

#### 2022
Since 2022 I am developing the [SecretPathway], which is a MUD client. The macOS version is written in Swift.  
A Java version will follow soon.

Earlier in the year, I wrote the [LeakSanitizer] and its accompanying [CallstackLibrary].  
The [LeakSanitizer] is capable to display the memory leaks of program that is linked to it.

The [CallstackLibrary] creates human readable callstacks at any requested point in the program.

#### 2021 - 2022
As a side project, I contributed to [four], a [MUD] written by [nijakow].

#### 2021
Since its opening in *June 2021* I am studying at the [42 Heilbronn]. This is a coding school which features a unique
learning model:  
Everybody is learning from everybody - without teachers. This principle, called *peer learning*, challenges the
traditional learning models quite successfully.  
42 schools can be found around the globe, see .  
My 42 intra profile can be found [here](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/mhahn).

Repositories containing projects belonging to the [42 Heilbronn] are preceeded by `42cursus`.

#### 2020 - 2021
Before starting at the [42 Heilbronn], I started to learn C++.

#### 2019 - 2020
Before I moved on to C++, I wrote the [ADB Connector] for *macOS* using Swift.

#### 2019
In 2019 I rewrote the [iSongs-RadioText] project, showing my capabities in Java.

#### 2017 - 2018
From 2017 to 2018 I wrote the [Project Backupper], a Java application to create backups. It features a server / client
principle, as it was supposed to create backups from Virtual Machines.

#### 2017
Earlier in that year, I wrote the first version of the [ADB Connector] in Java.

In the same year, I wrote the [Object Converter], a Java application that converts 3D worlds between the well-known
[Wavefront] format and my own format, called **G**raphic**W**orld**O**bjects.

#### 2016 - 2017
I wrote that tool as I was experimenting with [OpenGL ES] on [Android].

#### 2015 - 2016
Prior to that, I wrote my first [Android] app, the [RockPaperScissors] app.

#### 2013 - 2015
Before experimenting with [Android], I wrote a music application in Java, after reading a second book about Java.

#### 2013
Prior, I wrote a desktop version of the Rock Paper Scissors game in Java.

### 2012 - 2013
In **2012**, I started coding by reading a book about Java.
